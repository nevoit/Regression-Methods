## Answers

1. B - No, PCA is not a feature selection technique. It is a feature extraction technique that decreases the dimensionality of the dataset and captures as much variance in the data as possible. It sorts the dimensions on the basis of their contribution to the predictability of the model, thus discarding the low significant features.
